          I pursued my studies starting in 2018,
          where I was introduced to computer
          programming languages <strong>C</strong>{" "}
          and <strong>C++</strong>. During this
          time, I applied my knowledge to
          implement common{" "}
          <strong>algorithms</strong> and{" "}
          <strong>data structures</strong> and
          optimize them. I also received an
          introduction to the{" "}
          <strong>Linux</strong> environment and
          linear algebra.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the following year, I shifted my
          focus to <strong>Java</strong>, where I
          learned advanced concepts of{" "}
          <strong>object-oriented</strong>{" "}
          programming such as inheritance and
          polymorphism. Additionally, I studied
          randomised algorithms and honed my{" "}
          <strong>SQL</strong> skills, including
          query writing, function creation, and
          trigger design. In my final year, I
          expanded my programming knowledge to
          include <strong>C#</strong>,{" "}
          <strong>Python</strong>, and
          <strong>Android</strong>. I gained
          hands-on experience with the .NET
          framework and{" "}
          <strong>entity framework</strong> in C#.
          Additionally, I received an introduction
          to <strong>web development</strong>{" "}
          technologies such as{" "}
          <strong>PHP</strong>,{" "}
          <strong>JavaScript</strong>,
          <strong>HTML</strong>, and{" "}
          <strong>CSS</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To prepare for the industry, I received
          training in software engineering,
          covering topics such as iterative and
          <strong>agile</strong> programming,{" "}
          <strong>design patterns</strong>,{" "}
          <strong>data models</strong>,{" "}
          <strong>refactorings</strong>,{" "}
          <strong>unit testing</strong>, and more.
          I successfully graduated in 2022 after
          completing a thesis in the area of{" "}
          <strong>software testing</strong>.
