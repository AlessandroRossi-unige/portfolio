          I began my studies in 2018, where I was introduced to the foundational
          programming languages C and C++. During this time, I applied my
          knowledge to implement and optimize common algorithms and data
          structures. I also gained a solid grounding in the Linux environment
          and explored concepts of linear algebra.

          The following year, I shifted my focus to Java, delving into advanced
          object-oriented programming concepts like inheritance and
          polymorphism. I also studied randomized algorithms and multithreaded
          applications and refined my SQL skills, developing expertise in query
          writing, function creation, and trigger design. In my final year, I
          expanded my programming skills by learning C#, Python, and Android
          development. I gained practical experience with the .NET framework and
          Entity Framework in C#. Additionally, I was introduced to web
          development with technologies like PHP, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
        </p>

          To prepare for a career in the industry, I received training in
          software engineering, covering key topics like iterative and agile
          programming methodologies, design patterns, data modeling,
          refactoring, and unit testing. I successfully graduated in 2022 after
          completing a thesis in software testing, which lead me to a
          comprehensive understanding of testing strategies and methodologies
          from a theoretical and pratical standpoint.
