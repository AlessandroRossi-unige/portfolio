          To complete my University studies I had
          to do an Internship and after careful
          consideration I chose Deloitte to work
          as a fullstack Salesforce Developer.

        <p>
          At Deloitte I started working on the TIM
          Sparkle Project while also preparing for
          my Salesforce certifications. At
          Deloitte I mostly worked on the backend
          features of the project, using Apex ( a
          javalike language), I implement new
          features, worked with the databsed, talk
          with the customers and test the new
          features. I also did frontend work on
          javascript.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this project I worked with a medius
          size team (around 25 people) where I
          experienced both Waterfall development
          and Agile development. Me and a collegue
          created the administrative section of
          our customer portal, where the admins
          create, edit and manage new users and
          their permission, to set these
          permission we connected to an external
          API service called C-IAM. For more
          information on my work at Deloitte
          please contact me.
